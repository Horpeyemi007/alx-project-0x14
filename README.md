## Usage Limits and Best Practices

- **Rate Limits**: The API may enforce limits on the number of requests per minute or per day, depending on your subscription tier. Be sure to check the documentation for specific thresholds.
- **Authentication**: Always use your API key securely and avoid exposing it in public repositories or client-side code.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Cache frequent queries to reduce load and improve performance. Use pagination when retrieving large datasets.
- **Testing Environment**: Use sandbox or development modes when testing to avoid hitting production limits.
- **Data Updates**: Regularly sync with the API to ensure your app reflects the latest information on titles and cast.
